# NAMESPACE_ID must be EXACTLY 10 bytes for Eddystone-UID.
# Your library supports `namespace_id=...`, so we can set it explicitly.
# Choose a project/company/site-wide namespace so all your beacons "belong together".

# ------------------------ ADVERTISING LOOP -----------------
# Strategy: alternate short bursts of UID and URL advertising.
# Why alternate? A single radio can only send one advertising payload at a time.
# Short bursts (â‰ˆ0.5 s) let scanners see both frames without waiting too long.
# interval=0.1 -> ~100 ms advertising interval (good for phones to discover quickly).
